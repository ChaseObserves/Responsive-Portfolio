      <p>Throughout my life, I have always had an insatiable thirst for knowledge, innovation, and most of all, creation. I began my college career working to become a medical doctor, but after putting in hundreds of hours of my personal time writing witty content, directing videos, and developing fun and original concepts, I started listening to those around me who told me that I needed to shift gears and enter a field with more creative freedom. I believe that a good idea is one of the most powerful forces in existence and that approaching situations creatively is infinitely more potent than looking for the answers in a guidebook. I am passionate about finding new ways to connect with people and I develop what I see in my mind’s eye with surgical precision.</p>
      <p>I graduated from Utah Valley University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Marketing with a minor in Business Management.. I have also had the amazing opportunity to become fluent in a second language, Spanish, by way of living in Guatemala for two years while serving a full-time mission for the LDS church. I am a believer that everyone should try anything at least once, as such I have become a man of endless hobbies; I can be found shredding on my skis, yelling at my TV while gaming, wrenching on my custom motorcycle, spiking over a volleyball net, sprinting around a soccer pitch, or getting bruises on the paintball field. My wife Julia and I, together with our infant son Atlas, currently live in Orem, Utah.</p>
